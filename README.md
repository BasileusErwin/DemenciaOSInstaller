# DemenciaOSInstaller
Installer for Demencia OS

Why other the same program in the other languages?
You can use the C++ version or Python version for understand better the code. And i created the Python version for a challenge myself 

# How to use?

C++

``gcc demOSInstaller20.cpp -o demOSInstaller | sudo ./demOSInstaller``

Python

You need install PyInstaller or you can use python3 demOSInstaller.py to.

``pip install PyInstaller``

``python3 -m PyInstaller -F demOSInstaller.py``

This generates a executable file with Python.

The path it's in dist/ subfolder.
